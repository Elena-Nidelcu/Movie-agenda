# CineScope

A movie agenda web app inspired by IMDb and Letterboxd. It combines the main functionalities of both apps. I took the functionalities which I use the most, i.e. this functionality is personalised for meðŸ™ƒ.

Users can:
- Add, edit, delete, and like movies
- Filter by rating, genre, duration, liked or not, title, and director
- Switch between light and dark themes

## Features

- Movie management: add/edit/remove your watched films
- Live filtering: by rating, genre, duration, title, or director
- Like system: mark your favorites
- Dark mode: toggle between light & dark themes
- Persistent storage: the app uses the browserâ€™s local storage to persist user data between sessions.


## Implementation

The site is built with React and uses the tool Vite. It uses Tailwind CSS and some CSS Modules for styling. All movie data is stored in the browser using localStorage, so the list stays saved even after the user refreshes the page.
